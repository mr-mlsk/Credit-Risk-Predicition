# Credit-Risk-Predicition

Project Overview <a class='anchor' id='Section_1'>

Credit default risk is the risk that a lender takes the chance that a borrower fails to make required payments of the loan. 

In this project, I utilized different learning algorithms including KNN, Logistic regression, decision tree, and the popular XGBoost to find the best algorithms, and on top of that, I also implemented RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to fine tune the hyperparamters and further improve the model. 

The final model has a 0.939 accuracy score and 0.957 AUROC score.
